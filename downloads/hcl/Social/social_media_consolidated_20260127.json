    "content": "Hi folks,\n\nPosted before about this but it\u2019s gotten so much worse I think I have to quit the diet unless somebody can help me. Almost 4 weeks in and I feel like quitting. \n\nLong tome sufferer of what chronic inflammation (15 years), joint pain, brain fog and most recently GERD which seemed to have triggered overnight 4 years ago. Doctors did Colonoscopy and Gastroscopy and only thing showing is again, chronic inflammation. Put me on PPI\u2019s every day but over time I was able to reduce this down to every 3rd day., but if I missed that dose I would start to feel nauseous and the acid reflux would start by that evening. \n\nThis is why I took up this diet. As part of it I decided to quit the PPI\u2019s to see what would happen. To my astonishment after a week I was fine, no reflux, no nausea, no IBS. I started to preach the benefits of carnivore to family members who also suffer with GERD. However my joy was short lived. It returned with a bang in the middle of week 2. It wasn\u2019t severe but all my food was coming up my neck. I was eating mainly beef, butter, bacon and eggs but it was so slow to digest. My dinner was still sitting in my oesophagus going to bed 5 hrs after eating. \n\nIt came to a a head last night I was awake through the night with acid reflux and nausea and my heart absolutely racing. \n\nI had been trying to go on Dr Sarah Myhills Protocol for upper fermenting gut which sounds exactly like what I am suffering from. Her approach is starve the microbes with a Carnivore / Keto diet, kill them with Vitamin C in the morn and Iodine later in the day, then flush them out with MSM. Any time I take the Vit C on an empty stomach my symptoms are exasperated. Like yesterday when I took 3g Vit C first thing. Followed by a cup of bone broth approx 15 mins later. This seems to be what triggered my horrible night last night. I seem to have a broken Lower Orsophageal Sphincter valve. \n\nI know some will suggest low stomach acid and to try Betaine HCL which I have on order to try, but if the acidity of the Vit C causes me to be so much worse, will this also cause an increase in symptoms?\n\nI\u2019ve struggled with this diet, 4 weeks in starting to absolutely hate minced / ground beef and eggs and my health does not seem to be improving as of yet, still brain fog, still inflammation, still GERD. I feel like I want to quit. \n\nMy gut seems to be key here. Anyone any advice or suggestions? Thanks so much. ",

    "content": "Hey!\n\nSo I was about giving crystal growing a shot, and was thinking of doing iron II sulfate crystals in specific.\n\nHowever, I read that in order to prevent the crystals becoming off colored, a small amount of sulfuric acid is usually added. I understand this helps convert any iron impurities to the sulfate form as well. \n\nHowever I'm in the EU, so sulfuric acid is scheduled here. Will it work fine without the use of it? I don't really feel like extracting it illegaly from a car battery.\n\nHowever, I do have access to other acids (HCL, fumaric etc.) If those work to prevent off coloring as well?\n\nGrateful for any advice!",

    "content": "I got diagnosed with HCL last Thursday. I had an idea it was going in that direction after a blood test revealed it might be HCL at the end of November. Fast forward to January and I had a bone marrow biopsy which ended up confirming HCL. Oncologist explained that I\u2019ll be doing a week of cladribine and weekly retuximab for 6 weeks. I may also get some injections to boost my immunity (Oncologist didn\u2019t say what kind of injection.. maybe growth hormone? maybe something else). He added I may want to take the first two weeks of treatment off of work since I\u2019ll be blotto during that time. I\u2019m hopeful I can get back to work after that while I wrap up the retuximab. \n\nSo far I haven\u2019t been upset or anything. In fact I felt a bit of a sense of relief because we \\*finally\\* figured out why my WBC kept going down. And actually, I did fall apart last night when I told my mom, but it was mainly because she fell apart. Anyway, I\u2019ll post updates to this thread as I go through it. Feel free to post your experiences with the cladribine+retuximab combo. Glad to have found a community that has dealt with this!",

I asked ai how to respond to the current message and rather then tell me what it say it says this is a scam this isnt how job application talk they dont message you. im not sure if thats true or not but looking at every thing it does seem a bit off? and looking at this sub there is a few other post about HCL Tech. so im unsure at this point since I didnt know job scams are a thing. anything blurred my either my name or email\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m5gao89aktfg1.png?width=1161&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01f339d92ea8c73520fd1a712ed5ed1c66b4714f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l9hby7laktfg1.png?width=1440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a0a0db3cf9acb442d0d5cb39887d0817b5a2a23\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yxydfrwaktfg1.png?width=1928&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1eeadc66caf51906525f0aba8e7ec4e662e76e3f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fv28l4abktfg1.png?width=580&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=84cf079c7cfb7df229d996f50dacc42d288ade3c\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l9chzejbktfg1.png?width=1340&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1de9821501fc2b4871331fd911d08abdb4e6e1a0\n\n",

    "content": "I got an H pylori infection in July 2024 while in Mexico. I had awful abdominal pain and diarrhea. I got treated within two weeks but was left with constant quiet gas after every meal. Before this infection I had no gut issues whatsoever. I could eat just about everything (except coconut). In the year and a half since the infection, I have had constant gas after every meal.\n\n# Gut History\n\nFrom August 2024 to July 2025 i made no real effort to fix my gas issue. I had a semi balanced diet. However I drank caffeinated beverages daily and chewed sugar-free gum constantly. Sleeping very poorly (5-7 hours). Fatigued almost all the time.\n\nIn August 2025, I made the horrible mistake of taking it upon myself to treat the issue using a hastily researched natural solution. I took oregano oil (181mg) and berberine HCL(500mg) twice daily with food for close to three weeks. I noticed no worsening or improvement in my gas but still regret this heavily. At the same time I began my low fod-map diet.\n\nIn early Nov 2025, I had an upper endoscopy w/biopsy which later revealed benign chronic inflammation of the stomach lining. (They mentioned that biopsy revealed no H-pylori or Celiac, also no ulcers)\n\nIn mid-Nov 2025 I had to take a two week course of Bactrim for skin related issues\n\nIn late Nov 2025 I began taking Accutane (Ive seen that it could affect the gut)\n\nIn late Nov-2025 Following the results of my endoscopy they prescribed me pantoprazole. I received a prescription for 90 days. A couple of days into the course my gas worsened and I begun having motility issues. Instead of having one bm per day, I was only having 1 every two days. By the end of week three I began having one bm every three days. I decided to stop taking the ppi on my own. After that i was stuck with the slow motility\n\nIn late December 2025 I took a SIBO Hydrogen/Methane lactulose breath test that revealed no sibo\n\nIn Early Jan 2026, I was told to take IBGard and GasX\n\nTwo weeks ago I realized that I was eating a whole lot of raw vegetables and was basically inhaling my food. I cut down on fiber heavy meals and chewed slower and noticed some improvement with the gas. I also noted that I felt more satiated after meals.\n\nAlso I began taking GasX and IBGard two weeks ago. GasX really did nothing, however IBGard has been showing some relief for gas while im on it.\n\n# Diet\n\nThis is all I eat. I haven\u2019t strayed from whole foods like this since August 2025.\n\n**\\*\\*\\*Current diet\\*\\*\\***\n\nChicken, Lean Ground Beef, salmon, butter leaf lettuce, romaine lettuce, red/burgundy beets, carrots, yellow/red bell peppers, cucumbers, blue berries, bananas, brown rice cakes, white rice, peanut butter, almond milk, regular water, green/ginger/ginger&amp;tumeric tea, oregano, thyme, black pepper, rosemary, olive oil\n\n**\\*\\*\\*Foods I recently cut out:\\*\\*\\***\n\nbrown rice, oats, papaya, spinach, blackberries ,almonds, walnuts, sesame seeds, dark chocolate, lactose free yogurt, lactose free milk, pecans, kiwis\n\nI stopped eating eggs in November because of the smell it contributed to the gas.\n\nI also stopped chewing sugar free gum in late November\n\nEverything else is either high fod-map or just stuff i havent eaten recently\n\n# Current symptoms:\n\n***- Gas:*** While i do have less gas now, I attribute that to the IBGard and changing how i chew (I assume i can\u2019t take IBGard forever). I burp but i think that\u2019s relatively normal\n\n***- Slow motility (or Constipation?) :*** One small bm every 1-2 days. I eat a good amount and feel that isn\u2019t reflected in my BM\u2019s or at least how i remember my BM\u2019s to be.\n\n\\- Low FOD map diet doesn\u2019t seem to working for gas (Almost 5 months)\n\n\\- I don\u2019t have abdominal pain or discomfort.\n\n\\- I don\u2019t feel nauseated after meals or in general.\n\n\\- Ive remained at a steady weight for a while. (No unintentional weight gain or loss)\n\n\\- No acid reflux.\n\n***\\*\\*Other recent observations\\*\\****\n\n\\- Recently after negative sibo test, i tried reintroducing high FOD maps items like apples and garlic powder and i got loose BM\u2019s\n\n\\- Taking omega 3 fish oil supplements (for Accutane dryness side effects) caused oily BM\u2019s\n\n\\- High histamine foods like spinach seems to cause flushing of the face. chocolate causes runny nose and flushing.( i really didn\u2019t experience this before)\n\n\\- High stress situations cause more gas and gut sensations.\n\n\\- sitting down also seems to cause more gas\n\n\\- Low blood pressure, like borderline. I never had that but assume its worth mentioning\n\n# Day-to-day Habits\n\nI drink a decent amount of water (3-5) bottles a day\n\nI don\u2019t exercise as much as i should\n\nI typically skip lunch\n\nI\u2019m no longer as fatigued as I was a year ago but I attribute that to diet and a bit more sleep.\n\nMy sleep schedule sucks but i get 7-8 hours avg\n\nI dont smoke/drink.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe gas has immensely affected the quality of my life. I hate being in public spaces. I really just want this to end. I miss being a regular person. I don\u2019t know where to go from here. I\u2019d appreciate any help i can get.\n\nTL;DR - Constant gas after H-pylori infection almost 1.5 years after initial infection. Constipation/Slow Motility after recent PPI trial. Negative for H pylori from endoscopy, and negative for SIBO from breath test.",

    "content": "Hey guys, thought I'd share a slice of humble pie today. I think it's important to share our failures so we can all learn the actual chemistry behind what we do.  Knowledge is power!\n\n**The Mistake:** Six months ago, I treated a salt-damaged brick wall with a standard masonry cleaner (NMD 80 - Hydrochloric Acid based). It looked great \u2014 the white stains vanished. Satisfied, I applied a masonry paint.   \n  \n**The Reality:** I went back to the site recently. The paint is peeling and popping off. The salt is still there.\n\n**The Chemistry (Where I went wrong):** I was operating under the assumption that \"Acid cleans masonry, so Acid cleans salt.\" **This is false.**\n\n1. **Solubility:** Acid does not dissolve salt; *Water* dissolves salt. The chemical I used was doing nothing that hot water couldn't do.\n2. **The Common Ion Effect:** By adding Hydrochloric Acid (HCl) to Sodium Chloride (NaCl), I was actually adding *more* Chloride ions to the equation. This can actually decrease the solubility of the salt, keeping it trapped in the substrate.  I ran a simple experiment to prove it to myself.\n\n**The Consequence:** Because I didn't remove the salt, I just dissolved it and let it soak back into the brick. When the water evaporated, the salt re-crystallized behind the paint. According to the General Services Administration (GSA), salt crystallization can exert pressure between **2,000 and 14,000 PSI**. Brick has a tensile strength of roughly 250 - 400 PSI.   \n**Result:** The salt literally pushed the paint (and faces of the brick) off from the inside out.\n\n[The salt fail in action. How it started - repainted - and then returning to a failed coating.](https://i.redd.it/5fapiat0asfg1.gif)\n\n**The Correct Protocol (What I** ***should*** **have done):** After diving into National Park Service technical docs, here is the proper way to handle soluble salts:\n\n* **Sequestering Agents:** Use a product like **Chlor\\*Rid** (or similar chelation agents (pronounced keeylation - another oops)). These chemically bind to the Chloride ions, \"sequestering\" them so they don't re-deposit and can be fully rinsed away.\n* **The Poultice:** For deep salts, apply a clay/paper pulp poultice. As the poultice dries, it physically draws the salt-laden water out of the brick and into the paste. You then peel the paste off, taking the salt with it.\n\n**The Takeaway:** \"Visual clean\" does not mean \"Chemically clean.\" If you are prepping masonry for paint or sealer, you cannot just wash salt away with acid.

Ever since then, everything has been hell.\n\nI haven\u2019t been to school since 9th grade and I\u2019m supposed to be halfway through 11th grade now. I\u2019ve missed two funerals, graduations, birthdays, and a lot more. I\u2019ve basically been inside suffering in silence, trying to fix myself on my own, and letting fear hold me back.\n\nWhat has helped somewhat:\n\nHCL reduced my symptoms almost instantly by about 70%\n\nL-glutamine helped me eat daily again, but I have to take it consistently or I go back to being lactose intolerant\n\nOne of the hardest parts has been the odor. It\u2019s been described as smelling like fart, weed, burnt rubber, and rotten milk breath, which has made everything even more isolating and embarrassing.\n\nThese are all my symptoms:\n\nExcessive stomach gurgling\n\nExcessive flatulence\n\nExcessive belching\n\nBrain fog\n\nDifficulty concentrating\n\nShort-term memory loss\n\nNasal congestion\n\nYellow stools\n\nFloating stools\n\nWhite tongue\n\nSecondary lactose intolerance\n\nHot flashes\n\nExcessive sweating\n\nJoint pain\n\nBone pain\n\nTingling in feet\n\nI\u2019m finally going to the doctor, but I\u2019m scared they won\u2019t do anything and I\u2019ll be left dealing with this on my own again.\n\nIf anyone has been through something similar or has any advice, I\u2019d appreciate it.",
