    "content": "During my B-school interview, I was asked \"What field are you?\" \n\n\"Instrumentation Engineering.\"\n\nThe professor chuckled. \"Another engineering seat wasted, eh?\" \n\nI don't remember my answer (it probably wasn't that impressive). I do remember, however, thinking: why is an engineer gaining an MBA seen as a waste?\n\nTo professors who have never worked in industry, or to students, it might seem that way. But look at the real corporate world, and you see a very different story. \n\nBy market cap, India's 11th largest company is Tata Motors, 12th is L&amp;T, 15th is Maruti Suzuki, and 17th is Tata Steel. All of these firms are dominated by engineers and most are led by professionals with both an engineering degree and an MBA.\n\nThe engineering services sector - consisting of auto, capital goods, industrial macginery and steel - is 3.5% of India's GDP and 25% of our exports. \n\nGiven this reality, don't engineering firms deserve the same level of professional guidance that one might offer to FMCG? \n\nPractical examples of business leaders with both degrees:\n\nSN Subramanyam, MD, L&amp;T (he of the \"how long will you stare at your wife?\" comment)\n\nGirish Wagh, CEO, Tata Motors Commercial Vehicles\n\nSunil Kakkar, Director of Maruti Suzuki (IIT Kanpur, MBA from AIT)\n\nTV Narendran, MD of Tata Steel (NIT Trichy, IIMC)\n\nSo, maybe an engineer with an MBA isn't wasting either degree - but using both to become a better professional. \n\n(For all the GEMs / GEFs out there.)\n",

    "content": "Hello folks!\n\nIn the last two months or so I think we have all read a lot about certain people's opinions on the composition of the Candidates Tournament 2026. How unfortunate or even unfair it is that players like Arjun, Keymer or Nodirbek are not participating instead of the likes of Bl\u00fcbaum or Esipenko, even Sindarov.\n\nFast forward 8 rounds into Tata Steel. Bl\u00fcbaum is sitting idly at 50% in a world class field, Sindarov is half a point behind the leader. Bl\u00fcbaum is closing in on 2700 and has missed two outright wins against Arjun and Nguyen, beat Keymer who many yelled should have been in the Candidates instead of Bl\u00fcbaum.\n\nI want to make a point that Bl\u00fcbaum is not there by coincidence or luck. He is European Champion of 2025, came in 2nd in Grand Swiss and held himself impressively against the best in the world, not only there but also now in Tata Steel. He is one of the most in shape players since the beginning of 2025 and has had a 12-months delta of +46 Elo. He quite clearly is playing 2700+ level these days, his opening preparation and work ethic is world class. So yes, Bl\u00fcbaum very much deserves to be there.\n\nConcludingly, someone fittingly said: You have to deliver when it counts. That's part of being a sportsman!",
