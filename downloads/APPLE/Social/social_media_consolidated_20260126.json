The typing experience and build quality they offer can be outstanding. At the same time, my setup revolves around three main systems: a Mac Studio at my desk, a MacBook Pro when I need to be mobile, and my gaming rig. The Mac Studio is paired with the Apple Magic Keyboard and Magic Trackpad, a combination I have grown very comfortable with and rely on every day for work.\n\nThat comfort is exactly why switching to a traditional mechanical keyboard has never felt like an easy decision. Most mechanical boards feel taller, louder, and less integrated into the macOS experience than what I am used to. The Lofree Flow 2 84 caught my eye because it felt like a natural middle ground. Its low profile design and Mac friendly layout suggested a smoother transition from the Magic Keyboard, while still offering a true mechanical typing experience that would fit naturally into my Mac Studio based workflow.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wda0q659vpfg1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d429879f987b121e77a25c9dead8fbb17d71c2dc\n\n# About the Lofree Flow 2 84\n\nThe Lofree Flow 2 84 is a low profile mechanical keyboard designed for modern workspaces that value both form and function. Built around a precision CNC aluminum chassis, it combines a slim silhouette with the solid feel of a full metal board. The 75 percent layout strikes a practical balance, offering dedicated arrow keys and a function row while keeping the footprint compact.\n\nDesigned for long typing sessions, the Flow 2 84 features hot swappable low profile mechanical switches and thoughtfully shaped keycaps that feel more natural than typical flat laptop keys. Tri mode connectivity allows seamless switching between wired, Bluetooth, and 2.4 GHz wireless use, making it equally at home on a desk setup or a mobile workstation.\n\nWith full VIA support for key remapping and layers, the Flow 2 84 goes beyond aesthetics to deliver real customization. Subtle white backlighting and clean industrial styling round out a keyboard that prioritizes comfort, build quality, and everyday usability over visual excess.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n6jccxt9vpfg1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8752d13238956d0b5bb493191a2f6ba54a6d84a3\n\n# Main Features\n\n* 75% layout / 84 keys\n* Ultra sleek anodized aluminum body\n* New 40gf POM Cloud Series switches\n* Gasket mount\n* Touch-sensitive bar for adjusting volume and screen brightness\n* Built-in flip-out keyboard kickstand\n* PBT+PC double-shot shine-through keycaps\n* Tri-mode connectivity (2.4GHz/ Bluetooth/ wired USB-C)\n* Compatible with VIA for customization and macro\n\n# Pricing &amp; Availability\n\nThe Flow 2 84 keyboard has a list price of $159.00 on\u00a0[lofree.co](http://lofree.co/). It\u2019s also available on\u00a0[Amazon](https://amzn.to/4rb0a7D)\u00a0for $169.99.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rk1h1hfavpfg1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f71469bbcb7b6663d3289807f7595bf6a7a4c56d\n\n# User Experience\n\nTyping comfort and efficiency were a big priority for me since most of my day is spent writing, editing, and publishing content. I used the Lofree Flow 2 84 as my only keyboard for several full weeks and relied on it for everything from drafting articles to final edits. It was easy to get comfortable with right away and stayed comfortable during long stretches of typing. I did not notice any meaningful finger fatigue or an increase in missed key presses, even during longer sessions, and the low profile keycaps felt good throughout the day. Noise was also well managed and never distracting in a quiet workspace.\n\nTo put some numbers behind that experience, I ran a typing test using Monkeytype and hit 79 words per minute. That is faster than my usual average of around 73 words per minute, and it happened without any real adjustment period. Accuracy came in at 98 percent, with consistency rated at 81 percent, which matched how steady and confident typing felt day to day. One thing worth noting is how flat the keyboard sits on the desk, even with the feet extended. I personally would have liked a bit more elevation, but it comes down to preference rather than being a real downside.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dhks5ujbvpfg1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc7f136b8aef12d3757951ae04a615edba5ee7d7\n\nmacOS integration was another area I paid close attention to, since even a great keyboard can slow you down if shortcuts or layouts feel off. I tested the Flow 2 84 in both wired and Bluetooth modes, but I ended up sticking with Bluetooth most of the time. I prefer keeping cables off my desk, and using Bluetooth meant I did not have to dedicate a dongle to my Mac Studio. In daily use, I did not run into any connection issues, and Bluetooth felt reliable and hassle free.\n\nWhat stood out most is that the keyboard was clearly designed with macOS in mind. Right out of the box, everything worked the way I expected. I did not need to remap keys or swap Command and Control functions, and all of my usual shortcuts for Spotlight, app switching, screenshots, and window management worked without thinking about them. Because the keyboard is low profile with flat keys, the transition from the Apple Magic Keyboard felt very natural. The compact layout and modifier placement never threw me off, and waking my Mac from sleep, even in clamshell mode, was quick and consistent.\n\nDesk ergonomics and workspace fit were also solid overall. I used the keyboard both with and without a wrist rest and paired it with my usual mouse and trackpad. During long writing sessions, my posture felt natural and pretty much identical to what I am used to with the Magic Keyboard. Hand and wrist angles felt comfortable, switching between the keyboard and pointing devices was smooth, and the keyboard stayed firmly in place thanks to its weight. Nothing about the ergonomics stood out in a bad way, and it fit cleanly into my existing desk setup without requiring any changes.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nAfter spending several full weeks with the Lofree Flow 2 84, it feels like one of the few mechanical keyboards that genuinely makes sense for a Mac focused productivity setup. It delivers a mechanical typing experience without forcing a dramatic shift away from the low profile feel and macOS friendly layout I am used to with the Apple Magic Keyboard. From typing comfort to macOS integration, it consistently stayed out of my way and let me focus on getting work done.\n\nWhile it is not perfect, particularly if you prefer a steeper typing angle, the Flow 2 84 strikes a thoughtful balance between form, function, and familiarity. For Mac users who have been curious about mechanical keyboards but hesitant to make the jump, this feels like a confident and comfortable place to start.\n\nFor more information, visit\u00a0[lofree.co](https://www.lofree.co/)",

    "content": "If you\u2019ve spent more than five minutes in the \"coffee enthusiast\" corner of the internet, you\u2019ve seen it. Sleek, industrial, and available in colors ranging from \"Matte Black\" to \"Candy Apple Red,\" the **Technivorm Moccamaster** is the undisputed icon of the drip coffee world.\n\nBut in an era of smart-brewers and app-controlled espresso machines, does this Dutch classic\u2014which hasn't fundamentally changed its internal design since 1968\u2014still hold the crown? As a veteran of the specialty coffee scene, I put the **Moccamaster KBGV Select** through its paces to see if it\u2019s a lifetime investment or just a very pretty countertop trophy.\n\n# The Tech: Why Copper is King\n\nMost cheap drip machines use a thin aluminum heating element that \"burps\" water over your grounds at inconsistent temperatures. This leads to that classic \"office coffee\" taste: bitter, flat, or sour.\n\nThe Moccamaster is different. It uses a **heavy-duty copper heating element** that rapidly heats water to the precise SCA-certified range of **196\u00b0F \u2013 205\u00b0F**.\n\n\n\n# Key Specifications:\n\n* **Brew Time:** 4\u20136 minutes for a full 40 oz (1.25L) carafe.\n* **Certification:** Specialty Coffee Association (SCA) &amp; European Coffee Brewing Centre (ECBC).\n* **Construction:** Recyclable aluminum housing with BPA/BPS/BPF-free plastics.\n* **Origin:** Handmade in the Netherlands.\n\n# Hands-On Experience: The \"Analog\" Ritual\n\nUsing a Moccamaster feels less like operating an appliance and more like using a piece of lab equipment. There are no timers, no clocks, and no \"bold\" buttons.\n\n# The Good: Consistency and Longevity\n\nThe **KBGV Select** model features a toggle switch for \"Half Pot\" or \"Full Pot.\" This isn't just a gimmick; it actually adjusts the water flow and hotplate temperature to ensure that even a small batch meets the \"Gold Cup\" standard.\n\n\n\nThe build quality is essentially \"tank-like.\" Because the machine is modular, every single part\u2014from the spray arm to the internal switches\u2014is replaceable. In a world of planned obsolescence, the Moccamaster is a rare **Buy It For Life (BIFL)** contender.\n\n# The Not-So-Good: The \"Plastic\" Controversy\n\nOne common critique is the amount of plastic. While the body is solid aluminum, the water reservoir and brew basket are plastic. While they are high-quality and heat-resistant, some users feel they lack the \"premium\" feel of a $350+ machine. Also, the spray arm, while effective, doesn't always saturate the edges of the coffee bed perfectly\u2014I often find myself giving the grounds a quick stir mid-bloom for better extraction.\n\n# Moccamaster vs. The Competition\n\n|**Feature**|**Technivorm Moccamaster KBGV**|**Breville Precision Brewer**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Control**|Analog (On/Off)|Digital (PID, Flow Rate)|\n|**Durability**|Legendary (20+ years)|Moderate (Tech-heavy)|\n|**Aesthetics**|Mid-Century Modern|Modern Kitchen Appliance|\n|**Warranty**|5 Years|2 Years|\n|**Best For**|Purists who want simplicity|Techies who want to tweak|\n\n# The Verdict: Who Should Buy This?\n\nThe Moccamaster isn't for everyone. If you need your coffee to start brewing automatically at 6:00 AM via a smartphone app, look elsewhere.\n\n**Buy the Moccamaster if:**\n\n* You prioritize **flavor and temperature precision** above all else.\n* You want a machine that will likely last **two decades** rather than two years.\n* You appreciate **iconic design** and a quiet, rapid brewing process.\n\n**Skip the Moccamaster if:**\n\n* You need **programmability** or \"smart\" features.\n* You are on a tight budget (the $350 price tag is steep).\n* You prefer the versatility of brewing espresso-style drinks or cold brew in one machine.",

Zohran looks even more like young George Soros and very little like his supposed father, an academic Muslim ethnic Indian who married a Hindu filmmaker ethnic Indian. Seems more like a staged marriage to give Zohran a legit back story. Zohran then somehow skyrocketed to political fame at a level unseen except perhaps Barack Obama whose parents seemed to have some CIA connections. And it is a demonstrable fact that George Soros has a thing for younger Asian women. He is on his third (much younger Asian this time) wife; the guy gets around and likely has many other children around the world. This one just happens to be the most charismatic. I think Zohran is not a Bernie Sanders style democratic socialist but instead someone who will win over NYC while slowly subverting American society like a worm inside a big apple. He is the test case for a global government run by Soros just as many cities in Europe are currently run by Soros-affiliated front men.",

What I\u2019m really trying to optimize for is whichever option arrives the earliest.\n\nI know there\u2019s no guarantee around M5 Pro timelines until it\u2019s officially announced, but I wanted to ask the community about past release patterns. Based on your experiences, when a new Pro chip launches (like M4 Pro previously), did ordering the new model early tend to ship sooner than keeping or ordering the previous generation around that same window? Or do older configurations usually still arrive faster despite extended ETAs?\n\nGiven that my current M4 Pro order is now pushed to March, would it make more sense to cancel and wait for the M5 Pro announcement in hopes of landing an earlier delivery window? Or is it still safer to keep the existing order despite the delay?\n\nCurious how others have navigated this when caught between release transitions.",

As soon as markets begin to dent the genuine stakeholders of this administration - and politically agnostic CEOs, etc., well, the current administration will shift. The Republican party will turn on Trump as time gets closer to the midterms -- and after the midterms, they will likely need to throw the current administration under the bus. If you think about it, the current administrations voice grows weaker with an increase in time being the denominator. Here's just a hope, and one that is unlikely at that... our country is able to elect an administration that is boring in 2028. \n\nI didn't vote in the last election. When the Democratic Party removed Biden last minute and allowed Kamala to run, I knew they lost it. Biden wouldn't of won, but they set themselves up for failure. What I do miss about Obama, Bush (Iraq, etc. - I know the counter-argument) and Biden were the long stretches of little to no newsworthy stories about the administration. \n\nAs for ICE, letting them wear masks and politicizing the agency is detrimental to our nation's future security. This is going to - and already has - turned into another defund the police movement --&gt; now just defund ICE. We need to have enforcement on immigration and customs. We should denounce the bad actors and apples, but I'm genuinely worried about the longitudinal effects of what we're witnessing. \n\nI honestly don't even know why I'm writing this. I guess at the end of the day I'm just fed up with polarization and Trump.

According to The Washington Post, the White House has urged ICE to \u201cproduce videos for social media of immigrant arrests and confrontations to portray its push for mass deportation as critical to protecting the American way of life.\u201d \n\nLast week, President Trump posted on Truth Social that ICE must \u201cstart talking about\u201d the people they\u2019re arresting in Minnesota, writing: \u201cShow the Numbers, Names, and Faces of the violent criminals, and show them NOW.\u201d When the footage doesn\u2019t suit the administration, it seems to have no issue doctoring images to suit its alternate reality, as it did on Thursday. \n\nAgents had arrested an attorney who was protesting at a local church, and the White House posted a photo of this woman that was altered, presumably by AI, to make it look like she was crying.\n\nA dark irony of our current age is that there is more video and photographic evidence than ever before, and yet propagandists can coerce or convince others to not believe what they can see with their own eyes. (See also: January 6, 2021.)\n\nIf the truth is ever to win out over propaganda, it can only do so in the face of overwhelming evidence, the collection of which has become ever more treacherous in the second year of Trump\u2019s second presidency. \n\nBut the news and footage of Pretti\u2019s death seems to have broken through the usual informational chaos\u2014at least to some extent. \n\nOn Reddit, Instagram, and Facebook pages, the videos of Pretti\u2019s last moments appear to have galvanized people who don\u2019t normally engage or post about politics. \n\nAnd it is thanks to the bystander videos of Pretti\u2019s killing that people are trying to hold the administration accountable. \n\nThis morning, the CNN host Dana Bash referenced the footage in an interview with Bovino, asking him why Pretti was shot after being disarmed. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to adjudicate that here on TV in one freeze frame,\u201d Bovino replied.\n\n \u201cIt\u2019s not a freeze frame,\u201d Bash said. \u201cWe\u2019re showing a video of one of your agents taking the gun away. And that happened before Pretti was shot.\u201d\n\nMinneapolis residents are risking their lives to document what is happening to their city. \n\nIn Pretti\u2019s case, doing so cost him everything. \n\nWe should believe what we can see with our own eyes. \n\nOne can only imagine what Miller and the administration might have said about the shooting and Pretti if there weren\u2019t an abundance of footage. \n\nThankfully, because of the observers, the world can see for itself.\n\n\\-Charlie Warzel, \u201cBELIEVE YOUR EYES,\u201d The Atlantic, January 25, 2026\n\nhttps://apple.news/AQD9sretWSGWaJkV2y\\_-nGw",

I'm not sure of the original artist's username or where they even posted these, but you've probably seen their arts all over mlp Pinterest, with the absolutely adorable lcs/fusions. I'm super paranoid of my characters looking like someone else's on accident and being accused of stealing, so I wanted to stray from the black diamond apple concept.\n\nAnother problem: Like I mentioned, he's adopted, and I imagined he would've been a slightly older colt when he was too. So it actually wouldn't really make sense for him to have an apple related name unless he was renamed, which feels icky to me.\n\nSo I was hoping to give him some kind of sky/weather related name since he's a pegasus. I've found very beautiful photography of skies at sunset and twilight that have that kind of purple and yellow scheme he has going on, but obviously I don't want to name him Sunset or Twilight because those names are taken by main characters.\n\nBut then comes the question, what the hay do I name him then??? If anyone could help me out, I'd really appreciate it!! \ud83d\ude4f\u2665\ufe0f",

    "content": "I bought an M4 iPad Pro 13\u201d in June of 2024 and as of last Friday the screen would not activate after going into sleep mode. I tried force restarts, plugging into my computer, updating and restoring, all to no avail. I took the device to a Genius Bar where the guy did all the same tests plus diagnostic tests to find nothing wrong. He couldn\u2019t, however, fix the problem so his best offer was to accept trade-in value ($685) or send for repair ($1000). He said that was all he was able to offer in-store and suggested I call apple support to see if they could give a better offer.\n\nApple support ran their diagnostic tests and also found nothing wrong with the device and recommended I take it to an apple store where they could examine the device more closely\u2026.\n\nSo I went back to the Apple Store where another Genius Bar staff person ran their tests and this time ran a test the other two employees somehow failed to run and found that the iPad was failing the system stability test, indicating that something had gone wrong internally and a component had failed/was failing. He gave me the same offer as before, but I think he took pity on my situation and offered 10% off a new device if I opted for the trade in. Crunching the numbers, this would be $1000 for a repair, or $700 for a new device.\n\nAs is probably evident, I did not purchase Apple care extended warranty when I bought the device. My understanding (perhaps wrongfully) was that AppleCare could provide insurance in the event that I damage the machine. This was a component failure after 18 months for a flagship device. It has never dropped, never been exposed to liquid, there is not a scratch on it.\n\nI stated my case to Apple customer service this morning and was given the same offer with no further options, citing that because I denied AppleCare there was nothing else they could do.\n\nAm I really out of options here? Because Apple\u2019s product has failed I am expected to be held accountable and take the hit? I feel like there is a reasonable expectation of durability for a flagship device and would expect Apple would stand behind their products. Evidently not.\n\nTL/DR: 2024 ipad pro failed on its own accord after 18 months. Apple won\u2019t honor a replacement as it is 6 months out of warranty. Only offer is an expensive repair or expensive trade in.",
