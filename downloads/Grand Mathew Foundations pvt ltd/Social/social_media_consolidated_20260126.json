The brand was built for modern, performance-minded consumers who value intention, control, and thoughtful design in the products they use \u2014 characteristics that align closely with Doseology's vision for next-generation stimulation.\n\nUnder Doseology's ownership, Feed That Brain now serves as a platform brand within the Company's broader oral stimulant strategy, supporting disciplined evaluation of new delivery formats that emphasize measured, predictable energy rather than excess or intensity.\n\nThe pilot represents an early step in Doseology's strategy to expand its oral stimulant product portfolio and evaluate pouch-based delivery formats within a controlled, data-driven framework. The products included in the pilot contain no nicotine and are designed to deliver measured caffeine-based energy, with an emphasis on predictability, consistency, and user control.\n\n**Strategic Pilot for Product and Market Validation**\n\nFeed That Brain was originally recognized for its functional gummies and nootropic formulations. Through its integration into Doseology's platform, the brand is now being evaluated as part of a broader initiative to explore non-nicotine oral stimulant formats aligned with evolving consumer preferences.\n\nThe pilot program is intended to support product testing, consumer feedback, and operational learning. The focus is on controlled delivery \u2014 emphasizing consistency and predictability in how energy is accessed, rather than intensity or rapid stimulation. Insights from the pilot are expected to inform future formulation, delivery design, and commercialization decisions.\n\n\"This pilot reflects a disciplined and intentional approach to evaluating new product formats within our platform,\" said Tim Corkum, President &amp; COO of Doseology. \"Feed That Brain brings a strong foundation in functional product design, and this initiative allows us to assess caffeine-based, pouch-format energy delivery under a measured and compliant framework.\"\n\n**Delivery Format Considerations**\n\nUnlike traditional energy beverages, pouch-based formats offer a non-liquid, portion-based, unitized approach to caffeine delivery that does not rely on sugar, carbonation, or large-volume consumption. Pouches are designed for controlled, unitized use, allowing consumers to better manage timing and intake in a discreet and portable format.\n\nDoseology's pilot is intended to evaluate how these delivery characteristics influence user experience and behavior in a caffeine-based oral format, rather than to compare performance outcomes versus other energy products.\n\n**Positioning Within a Global Energy-Focused Category**\n\nThe global market for energy-focused consumer products continues to expand across multiple formats. According to\u00a0Grand View Research, the global energy drinks market \u2014 a leading segment within the broader energy category \u2014 was estimated at approximately USD $79.4 billion in 2024 and is projected to exceed USD $125 billion by 2030, reflecting sustained consumer demand for energy-oriented products.\n\nAt the same time, consumer and regulatory scrutiny around sugar content, portion size, and excess consumption has contributed to growing interest in alternative formats for caffeine intake. As energy drinks face scrutiny for sugar and excess, smaller companies are increasingly testing alternative ways people consume caffeine \u2014 with an emphasis on control rather than intensity.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Doseology's pilot reflects an effort to evaluate how pouch-based delivery formats \u2014 independent of nicotine \u2014 may be applied to caffeine-based energy use cases, emphasizing control, consistency, and user choice in how energy is accessed. The pilot is exploratory in nature and does not represent a commercial launch.\n\n\"Feed That Brain was created to support focus and performance in everyday life,\" said Joseph Mimran, co-founder of Feed That Brain and an equity holder of Doseology Sciences Inc. \"I'm encouraged by Doseology's disciplined approach to product development, regulatory compliance, and brand building as this next chapter unfolds.\"\n\n**Pilot Scope and Next Steps**\n\nThe Feed That Brain pilot run is expected to be introduced through a limited direct-to-consumer initiative within the coming weeks, with timing to be announced by management. The pilot is designed to generate real-world insights and operational feedback, supporting Doseology's broader objectives to refine delivery formats, strengthen commercialization capabilities, and evaluate scalable pathways for future product development.\n\n**About Doseology Sciences Inc**.\u00a0**(CSE: MOOD, PINK: DOSEF, FSE: VU70)**\n\nDoseology Sciences Inc. operates in the oral stimulant sector as a next-generation platform focused on rethinking how consumers access energy and stimulation through better-for-you formats. The Company emphasizes product innovation, intellectual property development, capacity ownership, and disciplined commercial execution, and pursues measured growth through internal development and selective strategic acquisitions.\n\n[](https://www.reddit.com/submit/?source_id=t3_1qnflnh)",

I had doubted it before, and asked secretly, and some municipal supervisors said that he was a shrewd businessman. Some people also say that Canada's construction industry is their Italian, and your Davroc testing laboratory is not easy to mess with, many kinds of saying.\n\nStrange affairs kept happening. At that time, I thought that I was involved in vicious competition in the capitalist industries. The components are Dufferin Gang and Eve Liu. Dufferin Gang is a group of notorious bad boys in North York with some consortium behind them. And Eve Liu used both Davroc and Dufferin to make me trouble, that is to \u201cpolish\u201d me. The \u201cpolishing\u201d of me stemmed from section 4.5, \u201cNewspaper News of Real Human Medical Experiments\u201d, in which she inherited her father's career of soul reincarnation experiment.\n\nIn less than two weeks after the \u201cJob Rip\u201d above, I was in a state of highly fearful doubtful and drowsiness, was already in a state of indistinguishable day and night (note 1). I thought I'm just a regular worker, earning a little salary to support family, shouldn't be involved in their big deals\uff0cnot necessary to take the risk of being expelled from construction industry or sent to prison. I resigned from Davroc.\n\nNote 1, these descriptions are uncomfortable feelings caused by prolonged periods of highly fear doubt and muddle.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qb5e7zzy1pfg1.jpg?width=2153&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f30c9542d8805ece7b29e01b499bf5dc80e7f042\n\n2\n\n\u4e8c\u96f6\u4e00\u96f6\u5e74\u4e94\u6708\uff0c\u6211\u5728Mississauga\u4e70\u4e86\u623f\u5b50\uff0c\u5728\u5bb6\u4f11\u606f\uff0c\u683d\u6811\uff0c\u770b\u5723\u7ecf\u3002\u6211\u89c9\u7740\u81ea\u5df1\u5e72\u4e0d\u4e86\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e86\u3002\n\nIn May 2010, I bought a house in Mississauga and spent my time at home resting, planting trees, and reading the Bible.

The first two months were fine, but I also doubted this and that. In October, they sent me to lead a small airport renovation project in northern Ontario. This project was a bit difficult and technically unfamiliar to me. The airfield was built during World War II, there is no foundation underneath, and the municipality has no money. Strange thing happened again. The measured data was very different from the laboratory data, and the measured data was also discrete. It was so discrete that I couldn't understand it at all. I suspect that Eve Liu changed the experimental data behind. I suggest using standard procedures to determine the standard density of materials from the site and then using on-site observations to determine whether the construction quality is qualified. Both LVM and the construction company agreed, but I didn't have any laboratory data to refer to, and this was airport construction.\n\nA few weeks later, my body and mind were in darkness again. When I'm on the phone, there are often lines on the phone, and while we're talking, they're in a meeting, chatting, instructing me in this way, or passing on information to me.\n\n4\n\n\u4e8c\u96f6\u4e00\u96f6\u5e74\u5341\u4e00\u6708\uff0c\u6211\u6536\u5230\u4e86\u5361\u5c14\u52a0\u91cc\u73af\u7403\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8\uff08Global Testing Ltd\uff09\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u9080\u8bf7\uff0c\u505a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u7684\u7ecf\u7406\u3002\u6211\u63a5\u53d7\u4e86\u8fd9\u4efd\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u9003\u79bb\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7ffb\u65b0\u98de\u673a\u573a\u7684\u9b3c\u5730\u65b9\u3002\n\n\u4e0d\u77e5\u4ece\u4ec0\u4e48\u65f6\u5019\u5f00\u59cb\u7684\uff0c\u6211\u7684\u80c3\u80a0\u5c31\u8d70\u52a8\u4e0d\u987a\uff0c\u6709\u5f88\u591a\u7634\u6c14\uff0c\u6211\u603b\u662f\u591a\u559d\u6c34\u6765\u901a\u987a\u80c3\u80a0\uff08\u6ce84\uff09\u3002\u76ae\u80a4\u4e0a\u4e5f\u751f\u4e86\u4e9b\u75ae\uff0c\u6cbb\u4e0d\u597d\u3002\n\n\u6ce84\uff0c\u7cbe\u795e\u75c5\u662f\u60c5\u611f\u521b\u4f24\uff0c\u80c3\u80a0\u662f\u6700\u80fd\u4f53\u73b0\u60c5\u611f\u7684\u5668\u5b98\uff1b\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8bf4\uff0c\u80c3\u80a0\u6e83\u75a1\u548c\u90a3\u4e9b\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u90fd\u662f\u5fc3\u7406\u75be\u75c5\u7684\u4f34\u751f\u75c5\u3002\n\n\u5728\u5361\u5c14\u52a0\u91cc\uff0c\u6211\u5bf9\u516c\u53f8\u8001\u677f\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u975e\u89c4\u8303\u4f5c\u6cd5\u975e\u5e38\u6709\u610f\u89c1\u3002\u6211\u8fd8\u88ab\u5e38\u6d3e\u53bb\u5de5\u5730\u3002\u51ac\u5929\u65bd\u5de5\u7684\u5f0a\u75c5\u5f88\u591a\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u4e3a\u4e86\u6323\u94b1\uff0c\u575a\u6301\u8981\u65bd\u5de5\uff0c\u6211\u5bf9\u6b64\u6709\u5f88\u591a\u62b1\u6028\u3002\u6ca1\u8fc7\u591a\u4e45\uff0c\u6211\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u91cc\uff0c\u5218\u5065\u541b\u7684\u4eba\u8ddf\u6211\u5230\u4e86\u5361\u5c14\u52a0\u91cc\uff0c\u7ee7\u7eed\u548c\u6211\u4f5c\u5bf9\u3002\u4e00\u6708\u672b\uff0c\u6211\u56de\u5bb6\u8fc7\u5e74\uff0c\u5c31\u6ca1\u56de\u53bb\u5361\u5c14\u52a0\u91cc\u3002\n\nIn November 2010, I received a job offer from Global Testing Ltd in Calgary as a laboratory manager.

The brand was built for modern, performance-minded consumers who value intention, control, and thoughtful design in the products they use \u2014 characteristics that align closely with Doseology's vision for next-generation stimulation.\n\nUnder Doseology's ownership, Feed That Brain now serves as a platform brand within the Company's broader oral stimulant strategy, supporting disciplined evaluation of new delivery formats that emphasize measured, predictable energy rather than excess or intensity.\n\nThe pilot represents an early step in Doseology's strategy to expand its oral stimulant product portfolio and evaluate pouch-based delivery formats within a controlled, data-driven framework. The products included in the pilot contain no nicotine and are designed to deliver measured caffeine-based energy, with an emphasis on predictability, consistency, and user control.\n\n**Strategic Pilot for Product and Market Validation**\n\nFeed That Brain was originally recognized for its functional gummies and nootropic formulations. Through its integration into Doseology's platform, the brand is now being evaluated as part of a broader initiative to explore non-nicotine oral stimulant formats aligned with evolving consumer preferences.\n\nThe pilot program is intended to support product testing, consumer feedback, and operational learning. The focus is on controlled delivery \u2014 emphasizing consistency and predictability in how energy is accessed, rather than intensity or rapid stimulation. Insights from the pilot are expected to inform future formulation, delivery design, and commercialization decisions.\n\n\"This pilot reflects a disciplined and intentional approach to evaluating new product formats within our platform,\" said Tim Corkum, President &amp; COO of Doseology. \"Feed That Brain brings a strong foundation in functional product design, and this initiative allows us to assess caffeine-based, pouch-format energy delivery under a measured and compliant framework.\"\n\n**Delivery Format Considerations**\n\nUnlike traditional energy beverages, pouch-based formats offer a non-liquid, portion-based, unitized approach to caffeine delivery that does not rely on sugar, carbonation, or large-volume consumption. Pouches are designed for controlled, unitized use, allowing consumers to better manage timing and intake in a discreet and portable format.\n\nDoseology's pilot is intended to evaluate how these delivery characteristics influence user experience and behavior in a caffeine-based oral format, rather than to compare performance outcomes versus other energy products.\n\n**Positioning Within a Global Energy-Focused Category**\n\nThe global market for energy-focused consumer products continues to expand across multiple formats. According to\u00a0Grand View Research, the global energy drinks market \u2014 a leading segment within the broader energy category \u2014 was estimated at approximately USD $79.4 billion in 2024 and is projected to exceed USD $125 billion by 2030, reflecting sustained consumer demand for energy-oriented products.\n\nAt the same time, consumer and regulatory scrutiny around sugar content, portion size, and excess consumption has contributed to growing interest in alternative formats for caffeine intake. As energy drinks face scrutiny for sugar and excess, smaller companies are increasingly testing alternative ways people consume caffeine \u2014 with an emphasis on control rather than intensity.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Doseology's pilot reflects an effort to evaluate how pouch-based delivery formats \u2014 independent of nicotine \u2014 may be applied to caffeine-based energy use cases, emphasizing control, consistency, and user choice in how energy is accessed. The pilot is exploratory in nature and does not represent a commercial launch.\n\n\"Feed That Brain was created to support focus and performance in everyday life,\" said Joseph Mimran, co-founder of Feed That Brain and an equity holder of Doseology Sciences Inc. \"I'm encouraged by Doseology's disciplined approach to product development, regulatory compliance, and brand building as this next chapter unfolds.\"\n\n**Pilot Scope and Next Steps**\n\nThe Feed That Brain pilot run is expected to be introduced through a limited direct-to-consumer initiative within the coming weeks, with timing to be announced by management. The pilot is designed to generate real-world insights and operational feedback, supporting Doseology's broader objectives to refine delivery formats, strengthen commercialization capabilities, and evaluate scalable pathways for future product development.\n\n**About Doseology Sciences Inc**.\u00a0**(CSE: MOOD, PINK: DOSEF, FSE: VU70)**\n\nDoseology Sciences Inc. operates in the oral stimulant sector as a next-generation platform focused on rethinking how consumers access energy and stimulation through better-for-you formats. The Company emphasizes product innovation, intellectual property development, capacity ownership, and disciplined commercial execution, and pursues measured growth through internal development and selective strategic acquisitions.",
